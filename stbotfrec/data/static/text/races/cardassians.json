    "empireDescription": "The Cardassians will go to any length to ensure the loyalty of their subjects.  They have a talented intelligence arm, known as the Obsidian Order, which can be as serious a threat as their military.  Cardassian diplomacy is at best a ruse, intended to distract and delay their enemies while they prepare to strike.  Their starships are designed for rigid, formation-style attacks, and often do not perform well alone."
