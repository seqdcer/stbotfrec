    "empireDescription": "The Klingons are among the most feared warriors of the galaxy.  They regard espionage as a dishonorable practice, but they are willing to defend themselves through internal security.  They are capable of diplomacy, but they regard it as a last resort; their preference is conquest and battle.  Their starships are fast and heavily armed, and very well suited to predatory group attacks."
