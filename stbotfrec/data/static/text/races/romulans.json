    "empireDescription": "The Romulans are a secretive people, enigmatic and often unpredictable.  Their talented intelligence force, known as the TalShiar, is as often directed at their own people as at their enemies.  They are capable diplomats, but they think little of betraying those who they perceive as inferior.  Their starships are equipped with cloaking devices, and are designed for devastating surprise attacks."
