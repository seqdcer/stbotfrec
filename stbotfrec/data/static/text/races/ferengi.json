    "empireDescription": "The Ferengi have built an entire society around the profit motive.  Their constant attention to the economic motions of the galaxy gives them an edge in espionage, but not in sabotage.  They are talented diplomats, although this is mainly due to the size and frequency of their bribes.  Their starships are fast but lightly armed; their wealth makes any individual ship easily replaceable."
