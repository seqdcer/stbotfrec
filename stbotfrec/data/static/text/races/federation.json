    "empireDescription": "The Federation is a free society, and its people value liberty and equality.  Their talents are better suited to research than to espionage; their technology is often the envy of other societies. Their diplomats are very skilled, and most Minor Races have a more favorable opinion of them than of their rivals.  Their starships are well shielded, and designed to function as well alone as in groups."
